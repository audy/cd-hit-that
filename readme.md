# CDHIT Thing

To run, do this:

    ./run <cutoff>
    
Where cutoff is the minimum number of reads required for a cluster to be reported.

A tab-separated sheet containing cluster, group (negative or positive), and reads for that cluster and group will be printed to STDOUT.

A fasta file `reps.fasta` containing representative reads will be generated.
